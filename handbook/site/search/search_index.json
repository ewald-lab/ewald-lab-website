Who would be excited about it? Get external feedback - do other people really care about it, and think that it's an important problem to solve? If people aren't very exicited about it even assuming complete success, you should probably pivot.</p> <p>Once you've identified an important problem, do some literature searches. Are other people working on this problem or question, or on something similar? If yes, this isn't a bad thing - it's further evidence that this is a worthwhile research topic that is probably tractable with currently available data and tools. If the space is too crowded it can be difficult to differentiate yourself, so there is a balance here.</p>"},{"location":"conducting-research/#2-know-how-to-evaluate-success","title":"2. Know how to evaluate success","text":"<p>In research, 90% of ideas fail. Many computational researchers may feel that the conventional way of performing an analysis is deeply flawed, and that some alternative might be better. However, without a clear and quantitative metric of what \"better\" means, it will be difficult (or impossible) to evaluate whether the idea is a good one. If you have plans for how you will evaluate your hypothesis/performance, get feedback from others. Is your proposed metric biased in some way? Does it miss some important aspect of your problem?</p> <p>You should also have some idea of what level of performance is good enough to effectively solve your problem, or what level of improvement will be exciting to others.</p>"},{"location":"conducting-research/#3-critically-assess-the-available-data","title":"3. Critically assess the available data","text":"<p>Even if you have a great research question or machine learning task and a plan of how to measure success, you will still fail if the available data is not of an appropriate size and quality. You won't know exactly how much data you'll need before starting, but you can usually guess the order of magnitude based on the computational methods that you plan on using. For example, if you only have 100 samples worth of data, training a deep learning network from scratch is not going to work.</p> <p>Your set of computational options is usually tied to your data size and quality, especially the state of the metadata. Keep this in mind when learning about new technology that allows scientists to measure new types of data or existing types but at greater scale - maybe the new technology enables investigations that you'd previouly dropped due to lack of data.</p> <p>Also think creatively about how existing sources of data can be used for new things. Is there a large set of images or text that could be processed with deep learning to turn them into something structured and ML-ready? Usually we think about a project originating from a research question. However, sometimes a project starts by identifying a new source of data that no one is paying attention to and asking \"what types of novel analyses are possible with data of this scale\"? Being the first person to analyse a new source of data is the easiest way to boost the novelty of what you're doing.</p>"},{"location":"conducting-research/#4-stay-organised","title":"4. Stay organised","text":"<p>Keep your code organised and reproducible in a GitHub repository, from day one. You are strongly encouraged to use a NextFlow pipeline. While there's a bit of overhead to learn, it makes it easy to try out different pipelines in an organised way. If you are trying out many different ideas, keep track of what you did, when you did it, why you did it, and whether it improved things according to your metrics, or if you learned something concrete about your research topic. Use sensible file and directory names, and add more documentation than you think is neccessary - future you will be grateful!</p> <p>The best way to ensure that your code is organised and understandable is to collaborate with others. If you share your code, you will be embarrassed if its awful. Your collaborators will also give you feedback if something is confusing. See the GitHub Guidelines page for more technical recommendations on how to structure your analysis.</p>"},{"location":"conducting-research/#5-write-early-and-regularly","title":"5. Write early and regularly","text":"<p>Many new researchers think that research falls into two separate steps: 1) do the analysis, and 2) write up the results. This is nearly always false. When you write down the motivation for your work, the main objective, what you did, and what the results are, you often realise that you haven't asked the most important question or convincingly proved your main point, and that your analysis is only halfway done. Reviewing literature for the introduction or discussion may give you brilliant new ideas, or you may find that your idea isn't as novel as you thought. In all of these cases, it's better to find out as early as possible, when you still have the time and energy to backtrack, expand, or pivot your plans.</p> <p>When you summarise and communicate your progress to someone else, you are forced to re-examine how your latest days/weeks of effort relate to your original objectives. Writing regularly helps avoid feature/objective-creep, and keeps you focused on the most important things. Write a proposal before you start working, work on an outline as soon as you start generating results, and keep track of literature that could go in your introduction/discussion. Accept any opportunity to present your work to others - making a set of slides isn't the same as writing a paper draft, but it helps to organise your overall ideas.</p>"},{"location":"conducting-research/#6-wrap-things-up","title":"6. Wrap things up","text":"<p>There are always more ways to incrementally improve some aspect of your analysis. Sometimes, implementing more ideas will degrade the quality of your paper because there will be too many results to coherently pull together into a paper that others will enjoy reading. Once you've evaluated your main ideas and explored a few additional things that came up along the way, it is usually in your best interest to narrow your scope and finish the paper.</p> <p>Often computational researchers procrastinate writing their first draft because they enjoy coding more than writing, and the thought of using a point-and-click reference manager and word processor makes them shudder. Stop it! Start writing the first complete draft! It's going to take longer than you think, and you're going to feel very good when you're done.</p>"},{"location":"conducting-research/#final-thoughts","title":"Final thoughts","text":"<p>The more rigorous and critical you are during steps 1-4, the easier the writing process will be. It's really fun to write a paper on an important topic when you have clear, quantitative metrics that show success and an organised codebase that can reproduce all of your results with minimal effort. Trying to write a paper based on a disorganized set of scripts that produce 1000 figures and tables but do not correspond to a clear research objective is excrutiating.</p> <p>For these reasons, Ewald Lab members are expected to write very short research proposals (~1 page) on steps 1-3 and discuss them with the lab (and ideally others) BEFORE they start analysing any data. This will turn into the outline for your paper, which will turn into your first draft.</p> <p>It's also very easy to get lost down rabbit holes and obsess over small details that really don't matter very much to the big picture. Stacking multiple small improvements on top of each other can collectively make a significant improvement (see the AlphaFold papers), but this takes laser-sharp focus, discipline, and organisation. Clearly stating your task/objective, having quantitative metrics, and regularly commmunicating your progress to keep yourself accountable is essential to ensure that your many ideas build towards an impactful end product.</p>"},{"location":"courses-overview/","title":"Useful courses","text":"<p>This is a collection of online lectures and tutorials that members of the Ewald Lab have found helpful. </p>"},{"location":"courses-overview/#practical-cs-skills","title":"Practical CS Skills","text":"<ul> <li>Missing CS Semester</li> <li>Learn Git Branching</li> </ul>"},{"location":"courses-overview/#deep-learning","title":"Deep Learning","text":"<ul> <li>MIT Intro to Deep Learning</li> <li>Zero to Mastery Pytorch</li> <li>Interactive explainers for CNNs, transformers, and diffusion</li> </ul>"},{"location":"day-to-day/","title":"","text":"<p>Here we describe expectations for regular lab activities and the day-to-day lab environment.

The format of the meeting will be lab announcements, a quick round table where each member briefly describes what they're currently working on, and a ~30 minute discussion led by someone in the group.</p> <p>Since our group is small, lab members will lead discussions frequently and you are not expected to have polished presentations - ugly slides or rough outlines in a Google Doc are totally fine! We will alternate between sharing project proposals, results, getting feedback on posters and talks prior to conferences, and discussing papers (\"journal club\").

Research-specific questions should be posted as issues in the relevant GitHub repository - see more information on the GitHub Guidelines page. If specific plans are made during in person conversations, please send a short summary email so that Jess has a written record (ie. Hi Jess, We just discussed that I will attend X conference in June. Thanks, Joe).</p> <p>We encourage social interactions and discussion in the lab office space, while still allowing everyone to focus on their work. Please use a meeting room for Zoom meetings instead of the shared lab space. If Jess isn't on campus, feel free to use her office. If someone has their headphones on and looks deeply focused, send them a Slack message instead of interrupting them. If you are trying to focus, feel free to silence your Slack notifications and close your email - you aren't expected to be immediately reachable at all hours of the workday. Do ask for help if you are stuck on something. A good guideline is 30 minutes: you should try to figure things out on your own initially, but if you are stuck for longer than this, please reach out!</p> <p>Our lab has some common Google Drive folders for organising our project notes, publications, presentations, and CVs. You should create shortcuts to these folders in your own drive following the Onboarding guidelines. Please keep all of the relevant documents in the common lab folders, for example don't keep your own set of project notes in a private folder. This helps to ensure that important documents aren't lost when you eventually move on to a new position. Please re-use presentation materials (slides, figures) from previous lab presentations if helpful, and make your slides in the same folder so that others can use yours as well.</p>"},{"location":"day-to-day/#3-office-vs-remote-guidelines","title":"3.

No need to ask permission, but please let Jess know ahead of time.</li> <li>EMBL is very international, and many people like the option of working remotely from their home country for short periods, for example a few days of work to meet hard deadlines in the middle of booked annual leave. This can put you in violation of residency and tax laws so please discuss these sorts of plans with Jess before booking anything so that we can check about grey areas with HR.</li> <li>If you are sick, please take time off to recover! If you have a cold but are well enough and want to work, please work from home until you are symptom-free.

There will be weeks where you've not made any progress, for example if you've been on annual leave or at a conference. This is totally ok, and you can cancel the check-in if there's nothing to discuss.</p> <p>Quarterly career check-ins: many people put off thinking about their next position until they are nearing the end of their contract (thinking about the future is scary!), but this is not helpful. The purpose of this check-in is for Jess to know if there are things we should do now to help you A) figure out if you're interested in a particular career path, and B) make sure that you have a competitive application once you have decided what you want to do. This could mean getting you involved in new projects that strategically teach you a new skillset, setting up a secondment with a company, registering for professional development training courses, or deciding to apply for a specific fellowship. Fellowship applications in particular require advance planning, usually 12+ months in advance of when results will be announced.</p> <p>Annual reviews: this is not meant to be a scary meeting! It is dedicated time for you and Jess to have a conversation on how things are going at a very high level. There should be no surprises - any areas where you can make improvements should already have been explicitly communicated during our weekly check-ins. One of Jess's main goals for this meeting is to get feedback from you about lab culture and practices - are there things that we can do differently to better serve all members of the lab? These meetings are only for lab members with multi-year contracts. If there is some sort of written review as part of your position (ie. annual Cambridge University progress reports for PhDs), we will fill out this form together during this meeting.</p> <p>PhD students also have thesis advisory committee (TAC) meetings once per year. It is very difficult to find time for three PIs to meet, so please start trying to schedule this 6 months in advance of the deadline.</p> <p>Please keep your Google calendar updated with your annual leave and work-related travel. It is helpful to indicate days that you will work from home; Jess tries to note her WFH days 1 week in advance. This is so that Jess can move 1:1 meetings in your calendar if scheduling conflicts come up. If she moves something last minute and you had already planned on working from home, this is fine and the meeting can happen on Zoom.</p>"},{"location":"day-to-day/#5-contributing-to-campus-life","title":"5. Contributing to campus life","text":"<p>The Ewald Lab highly values contributions towards a fun, inclusive, and engaging campus life. Some of this is at a professional level - being able to approach another scientist (no matter how senior / famous they are) and strike up a conversation is a valuable skillset that can be learned, even by extreme introverts :) If EBI or Sanger is hosting a seminar on a topic clearly related to your work, you are expected to attend in person. As a small and diverse research department, most seminars will be poorly attended if people only go to those directly related to their work - this is a bit awkward. You are encouraged to also attend seminars that are not related to your work, and to volunteer to meet with the speaker either alone or in a small group during their campus visit. This is a great way to practice networking.</p> <p>We also value organising and participating in social events that are not related to research at all, ideally including people outside of our lab. These types of interactions build relationships that make us more resilent, make campus life more enjoyable, and can lead to entirely unanticipated scientific collaborations. Many people on campus are bound by the shuttle schedule - therefore, a bit of wiggle room on scheduling social events during the work day is ok (ie. short foosball tournament, tangentially science-related documentary screening, etc). If you have an idea for an event, bring it up in lab meeting for feedback. Jess might be able to help with advertising, finding supporting budget, booking space, etc. Silly ideas are very welcome, but please be thoughtful of others - no jokes poking fun on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex, gender, religion, or sexual orientation.

This does not mean that you are expected to reply immediately, or that you should be working outside of work hours. Sometimes you may, through pure coincidence, have many deadlines at the same time that require working in the evenings/weekends to meet. If you find that this is regularly happening and you are overwhelmed with your workload, bring it up with Jess and we can discuss time management strategies, re-evaluate your commitments, and potentially bring on extra collaborators to make workloads more reasonable.</p>"},{"location":"day-to-day/#7-attending-conferences-and-workshops","title":"7. Attending conferences and workshops","text":"<p>Conferences are an important way to grow your network and learn about new research. Giving a very good conference presentation can have a greater positive impact on your career than publishing the related paper - conferences are popular places to recruit and build new collaborations. The lab can usually support each member attending one conference outside of the UK per year, although conferences that are very far away may need additional consideration. Some fellows (PhDs, some postdocs) have a dedicated budget that can be used to fund conference / training attendance - you have some freedom in how this is allocated. Applying for travel grants or presenting on behalf of a project with dedicated travel funds could enable you to attend more than one international conference per year. Do not register for conferences on your own; the research office will directly pay the registration fee to avoid extra paperwork associated with reimbursements.</p> <p>Keep an eye out for local workshops and symposia. The Cambridge area is a rich scientific hub and Jess is very supportive of you taking advantage of these opportunities. The lab budget should be able to cover most local events, but check with Jess before registering. Sometimes volunteers are given free registrations.</p> <p>If you'd like to attend a conference, please give Jess lots of notice before abstract submission deadlines (4 weeks or more). The main reason is that our lab collaborates a lot with industry and government, and some of these institutions have mandatory internal abstract reviews and may need several weeks notice. If you are presenting a poster or giving a talk, please finish your materials in advance (2 weeks for a poster, 4 weeks for a talk). You should arrange to practice your presentation or get feedback on your poster in a lab meeting before the conference. This helps you, and it also helps newer lab members who may not have attended conferences before.</p>"},{"location":"day-to-day/#8-collaborations","title":"8. Collaborations","text":"<p>Our lab engages in many collaborations - with other academic labs (especially ones that generate data), and also industry and government scientists. Do not share project data or results externally unless you've checked with collaborators. It's easy to spend a lot of time doing analyses that someone asked for in a large group call on a whim - before investing significant time, you should understand how essential the analysis is towards the main project objectives. Make sure you know your role in any related publications as your responsibilities should change if you are in a first or middle authorship position. If you aren't sure, discuss with Jess and she will initiate discussions to clarify roles if need be. These conversations can be a bit awkward, so its best to have them early and explicitly before different parties invest significant resources.</p> <p>You are encouraged to initiate your own collaborations, however please discuss with Jess before committing to anything, to ensure that the work aligns with your longterm goals and that you have enough bandwidth to deliver on any promises.

Additionally, many pharmaceuticals fail clinical trials due to toxicity not predicted by preclinical models, draining resources and increasing the costs for developing new therapeutics. Traditional toxicity testing methods are based on exposing animals to chemicals and observing high-level endpoints like mortality, impacts on reproduction, and incidence of tissue lesions and tumors. They cannot fill this information gap, for multiple reasons:</p> <p>They are too expensive and time consuming to assess risk for large numbers of chemicals They are ethically concerning - members of society are increasingly calling for the end of animal testing They produce limited information on the molecular mechanisms of toxicity, which makes it extremely difficult to extrapolate risk assessments across different species and life stages and sexes</p>"},{"location":"reading/1-tox21/#toxicity-testing-in-the-21st-century","title":"Toxicity testing in the 21st century","text":"<p>For decades, toxicologists and regulators have been advocating for a paradigm shift in how chemical toxicity is assessed. Instead of relying on in vivo animal testing, a suite of in silico and in vitro models should be used to gain insights on how chemicals are distributed throughout biological systems upon exposure, how they interact with macromolecules to perturb cells, and to predict whether these exposures and perturbations could cause adverse health outcomes in whole organisms. The vision for this paradigm shift for human chemical risk assessment was articulated by the United States National Research Council in a book called \u2018Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century\u2019 (free PDF, concept abbreviated as TT21C). The entire 200-page book is quite accessible, and worth downloading even if just for the summary section (pages 1-17). There was also a short summary published as a scientific article, as well as an update on the progress and future outlook published 10 years later.</p>"},{"location":"reading/1-tox21/#adverse-outcome-pathways","title":"Adverse outcome pathways","text":"<p>Ecotoxicologists face an even more daunting challenge - they must assess the risk of chemical exposure to all species within a given ecosystem. At around the same time that the TT21C book was written, ecotoxicologists came up with the concept of \u201cadverse outcome pathways\u201d (introductory conceptual paper, abbreviation AOP). AOPs are a theoretical framework that link a molecular-level event caused by a chemical to a series of biological changes leading to an adverse health outcome. The main goal was to organise information such that molecular changes could be mechanistically linked to adverse outcomes that regulators cared about, providing a logical basis for assessing the risk of exposure to chemical mixtures and enabling extrapolation of biological responses across species.</p> <p>While TT21C originated in the context of human health and AOPs in ecotoxicology, both concepts are now widely recognized as valuable tools for advancing understanding and assessment in both human and ecological health, with broad applicability across disciplines. Since 2009, much of the work in this area has been encompassed under the development of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs). NAMs are non-animal testing strategies that include in vitro assays, computational models, and high-throughput screening techniques to assess chemical safety more efficiently, ethically, and often yielding detailed mechanistic insights.</p>"},{"location":"reading/1-tox21/#toxicogenomics-data","title":"Toxicogenomics data","text":"<p>Many NAMs are targeted in vitro assays that measure one thing, for example the activity of a single transcription factor or the activation of a particular cell death signaling pathway. While these are relatively easy to interpret, it is not logistically feasible to measure thousands of targeted assays simultaneously to capture all of biological space. Because of this, there is great interest in using cell profiling and omics data to measure hundreds to thousands of endpoints simultaneously. When omics data is collected within the context of toxicology, it is sometimes called \u2018toxicogenomics data\u2019. For introduction, read this great review of toxicogenomics data for human health, this vision for basing chemical risk assessment on omics data, and the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s blueprint for computational toxicology, which explains how omics data fits into the big picture is here.</p> <p>Other sources of information include scientific associations (we mainly engage with the Society for Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, Eurotox, and the Society of Toxicology) and popular science books.

While we are interested in using all forms of cell profiling (transcriptomic, metabolomic, etc), we are especially interested in image-based cell profiling because it is very cheap and amenable to high-throughput screens. Our work has applications in both regulatory toxicology (protecting humans and ecosystems from unintended chemical exposures) and pharmaceutical toxicology (assessing the safety of compounds that are designed to perturb human biology). Beyond direct applications of cell profiling to toxicology, we are also interested in pushing the boundaries of the types of information that can be detected / extracted from images of cells.
