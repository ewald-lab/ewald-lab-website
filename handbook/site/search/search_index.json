Our group uses cell profiling to understand what compounds do to cells, with a long-term goal of developing new computational methods that predict in vivo toxicity from in vitro exposures (Section 1) . While we are interested in using all forms of cell profiling (transcriptomic, metabolomic, etc), our expertise in image-based cell profiling differentiates us from other groups in the same space (Section 2). Our work has applications in both regulatory toxicology (protecting humans and ecosystems from unintended chemical exposures, Section 3) and pharmaceutical toxicology (assessing the safety of compounds that are designed to perturb human biology, Section 4). Beyond direct applications of cell profiling to toxicology, we are also interested in pushing the boundaries of the types of information that can be detected / extracted from images of cells (Section 5). Our work in this area is sometimes more towards fundamental single-cell biology (Section 6). </p> <p>All Ewald Lab members should have familiarity with the conceptual/review papers in section 1 and 2, as these provide the foundation for the big picture that the lab is working towards. Each individual member will likely focus their research on one of sections 3-6, with work that is more application (3 &amp; 4), methods (5), or basic research (6) focused. </p>"}]}
