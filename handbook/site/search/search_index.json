If you are able to bring some of your own funding or plan to apply for a fellowship, please indicate this in your initial email. We are always willing to support fellowship applications when there is a good fit between the person, the project, and our lab!</p> <p>Please see below for more details depending on your circumstances.</p>"},{"location":"join-lab/#interns","title":"Interns","text":"<p>Internships are usually for senior undergraduate (3rd or 4th year) or Masters students. Most internships should be for 6 months or more; only in exceptional circumstances would we consider a 3-4 month internship as it usually takes several months before new lab members are familiar enough with our data and methods to make meaningful progress in their project.

For queries regarding the programme, please contact the EBI Research Office (roffice@ebi.ac.uk). The next recruitment round opens September 2025, for a start date of Fall 2026. The application process is jointly conducted across all EMBL sites and labs. To ensure that your application reaches my eyes, please indicate my name and the EBI UK site in the application questions that ask about specific Group Leaders and locations. Please also highlight any courses or research experience that you have related to machine learning, omics data analysis, image analysis, and/or toxicology.</p>"},{"location":"join-lab/#postdocs","title":"Postdocs","text":"<p>I am always interested in supporting postdoctoral fellowship applications - if you've identified a fellowship that fits with your timelines, please give those details in your introductory email. There are some EMBL-specific postdoctoral fellowships that you can consider. Please contact me well in advance of the application deadlines (several months at least) so that I can provide adequate support during the writing process, and so that we have time to sort out any potential administrative details related to hosting your fellowship at EMBL.</p>"},{"location":"onboarding/","title":"Onboarding","text":""},{"location":"onboarding/#first-day","title":"First day","text":"<p>On the first day, you should:</p> <ul> <li>Get your temporary access badge from security.</li> <li>Basic IT: pick up your EBI laptop, connect to the EBI network and sign into your email account.</li> <li>Choose a desk and set up your keyboard and mouse. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"onboarding/#first-week","title":"First week","text":"<p>Within the first week, you should:</p> <ul> <li>Add your contact and logistical details to the lab contact spreadsheet.

Our group uses cell profiling to understand what compounds do to cells, with a long-term goal of developing new computational methods that predict in vivo toxicity from in vitro exposures (Section 1) . While we are interested in using all forms of cell profiling (transcriptomic, metabolomic, etc), our expertise in image-based cell profiling differentiates us from other groups in the same space (Section 2). Our work has applications in both regulatory toxicology (protecting humans and ecosystems from unintended chemical exposures, Section 3) and pharmaceutical toxicology (assessing the safety of compounds that are designed to perturb human biology, Section 4). Beyond direct applications of cell profiling to toxicology, we are also interested in pushing the boundaries of the types of information that can be detected / extracted from images of cells (Section 5). Our work in this area is sometimes more towards fundamental single-cell biology (Section 6).</p> <p>All Ewald Lab members should have familiarity with the conceptual/review papers in section 1 and 2, as these provide the foundation for the big picture that the lab is working towards. Each individual member will likely focus their research on one of sections 3-6, with work that is more application (3 &amp; 4), methods (5), or basic research (6) focused. </p>"}]}
