We welcome inquiries from students and researchers at all levels who are passionate about the intersection of computational biology and environmental toxicology. If youâ€™re interested in joining the lab, please email Jess at <jewald@ebi.ac.uk> with a brief statement of your interests and your CV.

We will always post new positions on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-ewald-17140072/), [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/ewaldlab.org), and the lab website, so you are encouraged to follow Jess on those platforms. If you are able to bring some of your own funding or plan to apply for a fellowship, please indicate this in your initial email. We are always willing to support fellowship applications when there is a good fit between the person, the project, and our lab!

Please see below for more details depending on your circumstances.

## Interns

Internships are usually for senior undergraduate (3rd or 4th year) or Masters students. Most internships should be for 6 months or more; only in exceptional circumstances would we consider a 3-4 month internship as it usually takes several months before new lab members are familiar enough with our data and methods to make meaningful progress in their project. We will not host unpaid or remote internships.

## PhD candidates

PhD students are recruited via the EMBL International PhD Programme, and receive their degrees through the University of Cambridge. For queries regarding the programme, please contact the EBI Research Office (<roffice@ebi.ac.uk>). The next recruitment round opens September 2025, for a start date of Fall 2026. The application process is jointly conducted across all EMBL sites and labs. To ensure that your application reaches my eyes, please indicate my name and the EBI UK site in the application questions that ask about specific Group Leaders and locations. Please also highlight any courses or research experience that you have related to machine learning, omics data analysis, image analysis, and/or toxicology.

## Postdocs

I am always interested in supporting postdoctoral fellowship applications - if you've identified a fellowship that fits with your timelines, please give those details in your introductory email. There are some [EMBL-specific postdoctoral fellowships](https://www.embl.org/about/info/postdoctoral-programme/fellowship-programmes/) that you can consider. Please contact me well in advance of the application deadlines (several months at least) so that I can provide adequate support during the writing process, and so that we have time to sort out any potential administrative details related to hosting your fellowship at EMBL.
