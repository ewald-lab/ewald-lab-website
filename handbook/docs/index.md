# Welcome to the Ewald Lab handbook!

This is a guide for conducting scientific research in the Ewald Lab. This is a living document; it will change as we identify new and better ways of doing things. It's purpose is to get all lab members on the same page, so that we have a shared understanding of both the big picture (ie. how to conduct a research project) and smaller day-to-day details (ie. lab meeting frequency and times) Resources that we do not have permission to share are private Google Drive links that can only be accessed by lab members.
