## First day

On the first day, you should:

* Get your temporary access badge from security.
* Basic IT: pick up your EBI laptop, connect to the EBI network and sign into your email account.
* Choose a desk and set up your keyboard and mouse.

## First week

Within the first week, you should:

* Add your contact and logistical details to the [lab contact spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wcVya1eI6ZEtw-3a-SycoaMAnsxDHSkaRRwVxiEXESk/edit?usp=sharing). Access is restricted to lab members, so you will likely need to request access. We use this in the case of emergencies, to record dietary preferences for lab events, and to coordinate birthday treats!
* Complete the health & safety courses available through Workday.
* Request access to the Codon Cluster using the link in [this article](https://embl.service-now.com/esc?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010495&table=kb_knowledge&searchTerm=codon%20access).
* Ask Jess to add you to the [Ewald Lab GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ewald-lab). Send her your GitHub handle in the request. If you don't have one, create a GitHub account with a personal email so that your access remains after leaving EBI.
* Read through the Github guidelines and Tech strategy pages of the handbook. Write down anything that is confusing or unfamiliar to you - you can go through it with Jess during your first 1:1 and she can suggest resources for learning them.

## First month

* Run through the example image-based profiling pipeline tutorial
* Run through the basic CellProfiler for Cell Painting tutorial on the Codon Cluster using an interactive HPC session
