## First day

On the first day, you should:

* Get your temporary access badge from security.
* Basic IT: pick up your EBI laptop, connect to the EBI network and sign into your email account.
* Choose a desk and set up your keyboard and mouse. 

## First week

Within the first week, you should:

* Add your contact and logistical details to the [lab contact spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wcVya1eI6ZEtw-3a-SycoaMAnsxDHSkaRRwVxiEXESk/edit?usp=sharing). Access is restricted to lab members, so you will likely need to request access. We use this in the case of emergencies, to record dietary preferences for lab events, and to coordinate birthday treats!
* Complete the health & safety courses available through Workday.
