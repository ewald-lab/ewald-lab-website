Images contain a lot of information; if we use computer vision and deep learning to analyse images of cells, we can define quantitative profiles that contain a comparable amount of information to molecular profiling techniques like transcriptomics or metabolomics. The big benefit of image-based profiling is that it is much, much cheaper than these other techniques. Our group works a lot with the Cell Painting assay, which is a type of high-content imaging designed to jointly maximise information content and throughput.

Here are some key papers on the Cell Painting assay:

* Initial protocol introducing the Cell Painting assay ([paper link](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.105))
* Updated protocol 7 years later ([paper link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-023-00840-9))
* Analysis of image-based profiles ([paper link](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4397))
* Pycytominer Python package for image-based profiling ([paper link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02611-8))
* Cell Painting Gallery ([paper link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02399-z))
* A review of Cell Painting applications ([paper link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02528-8))

To learn how to use CellProfiler to process Cell Painting images, run through the [beginner segmentation CellProfiler tutorial](https://tutorials.cellprofiler.org/#beginner-segmentation) following [this recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXHOuRcxr-A&list=PLXSm9cHbSZBBy7JkChB32_e3lURUcT3RL&index=6). You can either do this locally or on the Codon Cluster by using the Xfce Desktop Environment available through the [iHPC portal](https://ihpc.ebi.ac.uk/). In the portal, go to 'Interactive Apps', select 'Desktop', and launch a session. You should be able to install CellProfiler and download tutorial materials just like on your local computer.
