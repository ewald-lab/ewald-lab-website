Images contain a lot of information; if we use computer vision and deep learning to analyse images of cells, we can define quantitative profiles that contain a comparable amount of information to molecular profiling techniques like transcriptomics or metabolomics. The big benefit of image-based profiling is that it is much, much cheaper than these other techniques. Our group works a lot with the Cell Painting assay, which is a type of high-content imaging designed to jointly maximise information content and throughput.

Here are some key papers on the Cell Painting assay:

* Initial protocol introducing the Cell Painting assay ([paper link](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.105))
* Updated protocol 7 years later ([paper link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-023-00840-9))
* Analysis of image-based profiles ([paper link](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4397))
