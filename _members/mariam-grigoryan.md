My research focuses on applying advanced statistical modeling to biological datasets, particularly from Cell Painting and proteomics, to extract meaningful patterns and biomarkers at the single-cell level. I aim to integrate these analyses into chemical safety assessment to help identify compounds with potential toxicological risks. I am a PhD student at Université Côte d'Azur and Bayer Crop Science, supervised by Vincent Vandewalle and David Rouquié. I collaborate with the Ewald Lab to pilot the combination of Cell Painting and secreted protein measurements from the same cells, for compound safety assessment.
