Jess is fascinated by computational biology and environmental toxicology, which she discovered as an undergrad at Harvard University researching heavy metals in marine mammals with Dr. Elsie Sunderland. She earned a PhD in Bioinformatics at McGill University with Dr. Nil Basu, developing statistical methods and software for analyzing toxicogenomics data from ecologically relevant species, followed by a postdoc with Dr. Jeff Xia to advance her bioinformatics and web development skills. Jess also completed postdoctoral training with the Carpenter-Singh Lab at the Broad Institute, where she used Cell Painting and multi-omics data from in vitro screens to detect chemical toxicity. She joined EMBL-EBI as a group leader in 2025.
