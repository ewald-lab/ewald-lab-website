Guillaume is a passionate bioinformatician with a strong background in machine learning and toxicology. After completing his Master's degree in Bioinformatics at Université Paris Cité, he specialized in toxicity prediction by developing machine learning models to assess the toxicity of chemical compounds at a start-up in Nancy, France. He then returned to Paris, where he developed a webserver to predict the odors of chemicals, before starting a PhD in Bioinformatics at Université Paris Cité under the supervision of Prof. Olivier Taboureau. During his PhD, he developed in silico methods that integrate transcriptomics data with machine learning approaches to predict and assess chemical toxicity. Guillaume is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Ewald Group at EMBL-EBI.
