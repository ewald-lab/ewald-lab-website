Pia discovered her passion for computational biology during her undergraduate studies when she pursued an internship at the Maastricht Centre for Systems Biology (MaCSBio) under the supervision of Dr. Michiel Adriaens. There, she used genome-scale metabolic modeling to investigate metabolic impairments associated with cardiomyopathies and diabetes. She later returned to MaCSBio to complete her bachelor’s thesis, focusing on immune profiling of cardiomyopathy patients using transcriptomic data. Pia went on to earn a master’s degree in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the University of Amsterdam. For her master’s thesis, she conducted two research projects in collaboration with Dr. Gustavo Stolf Jeuken at the Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences. Her work focused on integrating a cell cycle model into variational autoencoders for single-cell transcriptomic data and on developing pathway enrichment analysis methods. In 2025, Pia joined the Ewald Group at EMBL-EBI as a predoctoral student, where she now applies computational approaches to investigate questions in environmental toxicology. She is particularly interested in combining prior mechanistic knowledge with machine learning methods to predict and characterise compound toxicity at the single-cell level.
