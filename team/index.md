## Postdoctoral Fellowship in image-based carcinogen detection

What if we could use deep learning to get a detailed picture of how chemicals cause in vivo toxicity at a spatially-resolved, single-cell level, decades after the toxicity tests were conducted? If this sounds exciting to you, [please apply](https://embl.wd103.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/EMBL/job/Postdoctoral-Fellowship-in-Image-Based-Carcinogen-Detection_JR2418)!
