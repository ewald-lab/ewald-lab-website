  description: We are measuring Cell Painting and metabolomics in human cells after exposing them to a panel of pesticides. The objective is to detect common modes-of-action to provide a rational basis for evaluating the risk of exposure to pesticide mixtures.

  description: Our goal is to assess the combination of Cell Painting, transcriptomics and proteomics in a variety of cell models for safety assessment of drugs, pesticides, and environmental contaminants, using hepatotoxicity as test case. We are a precompetitive collaboration between 31 academic, non-profit, industry, and government institutions.

  description: In this project, we are applying deep learning methods to images of H&E-stained tissue slides collected after exposing rodents to carcinogens to investigate mutagenic and non-mutagenic modes-of-action at a spatially-resolved, single-cell level. This project is in collaboration with the United States NIEHS and the Coorens Lab at EMBL-EBI.
