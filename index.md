## The Big Problem

So many chemicals, mainly untested.

## A New Paradigm

Toxicity testing in the 21st century.

## The Computational Biology Challenge

Even with technological advances, a brute force approach of measuring all endpoints after every possible chemical exposure in all biological contexts is not feasible. Fortunately, high-content omics data enables us to measure thousands of transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and cell morphology features. Thus, the challenge is to deconvolve interpretable and biologically meaningful signals from omics datasets, and to use prior biological knowledge to extrapolate observations across biological contexts.

## Our Solution

We mine high-content omics data to detect and characterize harzardous biological responses to chemical exposures at environmentally-relevant levels. We use data integration and transfer learning to extrapolate findings across biological scales, cell and tissue types, species, life stages, and sex. We work with academia-industry-government-nonprofit consortia to develop translational applications.
