## The Big Problem
{% capture col1 %}
Despite the fact that environmental contaminants cause 16% of premature deaths worldwide, most chemicals in commercial use have never been assessed for their potential to cause harm to humans or ecosystems. Traditional toxicity testing methods that use live animals are too expensive, slow, and ethically concerning to assess chemical hazard at scale.

## A New Paradigm

Drug discovery programs routinely screen tens of thousands of compounds in computational and cellular models for their potential to treat disease. What if we used this same technology to assess whether chemicals used in society are dangerous? Scientists and regulators around the world are urgently working to make this a reality.

## Computational Biology Challenges

Given the vast chemical space and biological complexity, a brute-force approach of testing every compound in all cell types and species is impractical. Instead, scientists must develop computational approaches that leverage prior knowledge of taxonomic relationships, cell types, and cell state to design efficient chemical screens and extrapolate observed toxicity across biological space.

## Our Work

High-content omics data enables us to measure thousands of molecular and morphological features from cells after they are exposed to chemicals. When we measure these data from in vitro cellular assays, we call it “cell profiling”. Using cell profiling data, our lab:

- Estimates the lowest chemical exposure that causes molecular perturbations in different tissues of living organisms (including humans!) for thousands of compounds

- Predicts how chemicals cause toxicity by analyzing images of exposed cells with machine learning, transfer learning, and multi-omics integration

- Creates user-friendly web-tools that connect cell profiles to toxicity data from diverse in silico, in vitro, and in vivo sources

We also value collaborating closely with stakeholders across government, industry, and academia to maximize the translational impact of our work.
