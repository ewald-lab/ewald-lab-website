# We identify and characterize chemical hazards to humans and ecosystems with cell profiling, machine learning, and integrative data analysis.

## The Big Problem

Despite the fact that environmental contaminants cause 16% of premature deaths worldwide, most chemicals in commercial use have never been assessed for their potential to cause harm to humans or ecosystems. Traditional toxicity testing methods that use live animals are too expensive, slow, and ethically concerning to assess chemical hazard at scale.

## A New Paradigm

Drug discovery programs routinely screen tens of thousands of compounds in computational and cellular models for their potential to treat disease. What if we used this same technology to assess whether chemicals used in society are dangerous? Scientists and regulators around the world are urgently working to make this a reality.

## The Computational Biology Challenge

Given the vast chemical space and biological complexity, a brute-force approach of testing every compound in all cell types and species is impractical. Instead, scientists must develop computational approaches that leverage prior knowledge of taxonomic relationships, cell types, and cell state to design efficient chemical screens and extrapolate observed toxicity across biological space.

## Our Contribution

We mine high-content omics data to detect and characterize harzardous biological responses to chemical exposures at environmentally-relevant levels. We use data integration and transfer learning to extrapolate findings across biological scales, cell and tissue types, species, life stages, and sex. We work with academia-industry-government-nonprofit consortia to develop translational applications.
